# üî• Unfortunately, the new network card decided to commit seppuku the moment I powered on the server. üî•

While upgrading one server, I decided to install a brand new network card with two SFP+ ports ‚Äî the goal was to add 25 GbE connectivity and improve overall performance. Unfortunately, instead of a smooth upgrade, I ran into a serious hardware failure‚Ä¶


As soon as I powered on the server, I heard a **distinct pop** and immediately noticed the **smell of burnt plastic**. The system didn‚Äôt boot, and after removing the card, I found **clear burn marks** near the power regulation components on the PCB.

It appears that the card suffered a critical failure right at first power-up ‚Äî possibly due to a manufacturing defect or internal short circuit.

## What to Do in a Situation Like This?

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Immediately disconnect power** ‚Äì If you hear a pop or smell something burning, shut down everything right away.
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Visually inspect the card** ‚Äì Look for burn marks, discoloration, melted plastic, or damaged components.
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Document everything** ‚Äì Take photos and write a description of what happened, especially if you plan to file a warranty claim.
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Avoid testing the card in another machine** ‚Äì A damaged card can potentially harm other systems.
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Contact the seller or manufacturer** ‚Äì Providing a detailed explanation with images helps your chances in a warranty or RMA process.
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Use proper power protection** ‚Äì Consider using a good surge protector or a UPS with proper power filtering for sensitive hardware.

## Lessons Learned

Even brand-new hardware can fail right out of the box. This experience serves as a reminder that upgrades should be done carefully and ideally step-by-step, especially when high-power or critical components are involved.

If anyone has experienced something similar ‚Äî or recognizes the chipset/manufacturer from this PCB ‚Äî feel free to share in the comments!
