<p>itreset-pl – a fresh start for IT engineering
“The future of IT restarts here” – this is more than a motto; it’s the direction that shapes our content.

If you're passionate about IT infrastructure, operating systems, virtualization, automation, networking, and building your own homelab environments – you're in the right place.

itreset is a blog created by a tech enthusiast who shares hands-on knowledge in areas such as:

+ server deployment and configuration (Linux, Windows Server),
+ virtualization platforms (Proxmox, VMware, Hyper-V),
+ network management (pfSense, VLANs, VPNs),
+ task automation (Ansible, Bash, PowerShell),
+ designing and testing setups in lab environments,
+ security and system administration best practices.

You’ll find step-by-step tutorials, real-world configuration examples, hardware and software reviews, and insights from day-to-day work with technology.

This is a space for those who want to understand IT not just theoretically, but through practical application.
We’re restarting the way we approach tech – with purpose, efficiency, and passion.
